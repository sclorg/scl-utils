.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents \fBscl\fP, a
program which is an utility for running software packaged as a Software Collection.
.PP
\fBscl\fP utility allows to execute an application which is not located in the filesystem
root hierarchy but is present in an alternative location. This application can still use
and benefit from software installed in the root filesystem. In order to let an application
be visible to the system one has to use \fBscl\fP utility as an interface.
.PP
\fI<action>\fR is a script name to execute in a bash environment before the application
itself takes in executed. Currently only \fBenable\fP scriptlet is mandatory which is needed
to update search paths, etc.

One can enable more Software Collections if needed and therefore one can use multiple
collections which are enabled by the left-right order as present on \fBscl\fP command-line.
.PP
\fI<command>\fR is an arbitrary command or set of commands to execute within the Software
Collection environment enabled. Control is returned back to the caller with the original
environment as soon as the command finishes. It \fI<command>\fR is '-' (dash) then it is
read from the standard input.
